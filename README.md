# NGDF Station 1800 

This application expedites the process that the operator just perform at the NGDF Station 1800. Previously, the operator had to spend too much time at the computer, scanning things multiple times and wasting time they could be using to fasten parts to the unit. In this application, the operator must initially scan their ID, which will then lead them into the MES Station 1800 page. From there, the GUI will reappear and prompt the operator to scan the pallet label, the Puma, and both MDLs. The unit will then go through its LabView process. following that. MES will then rise back to the top of the screen and go through each of the scans made and check off that they correct. After that, the process is complete!


Comments:

If any scan is inputted incorrectly, there will be popups that indicate the error. The operator can than go back to the GUI and scan the correct part.

If the application seems to be faulty by any means,  the operator can go into the two software manually and complete the station that way as well.
