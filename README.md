# PressBrakeProject

This is a compilation of software that allows the user to take full advantage of the malleability of Cincinnati's pres brake programs

The main goal of this projects is to change the name of the tools, but there is so much more these programs can do.

If you need help and don't know where to start, then you probably look like the dog in the picture... So go ahead and click it!!!

Have fun modifiying your files.



Special thanks to Jeremy Surage who helped me get this project off the ground
